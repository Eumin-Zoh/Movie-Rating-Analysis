# Movie-Rating-Analysis
It is a project to determine if Fandango's ratings in 2015 had a bias towards rating movies better to sell more tickets.

Referring to this article, the question came to my mind. https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/fandango-movies-ratings/

If you are planning on going for a movie, how well can you trust online reviews and ratings? Especially if the same company showing the rating also makes money by selling movie tickets. Do they have a bias towards rating movies higher than they should be rated?
